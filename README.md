## Maslow's Hammer (The Law of the Instrument)

> "If your tool belt only has a hammer, you will be tempted to treat everything as a nail."

### Key Takeaway:

Leverage the context to find more efficient solutions rather than relying solely on familiar tools.

## Understanding Data Structures

A **Data Structure** is a specific solution for organizing data that provides storage for items and capabilities (actions/methods) for storing and retrieving them.

### Classification:

- **Abstract**: Defined by its operations and computational complexity without details on physical memory or storage.
- **Concrete**: A physical implementation of an Abstract Data Type (ADT).

### Abstract Data Type (ADT):

An ADT specifies:

1. Operations that can be performed on the data.
2. Computational complexity of those operations.

**Example:**
An ADT for a static array might specify:

- A container that stores a fixed number of elements.
- Each element is associated with an index (position).
- Supports random access to elements by their position.

**Concrete Implementation Details:**

1. Will the array size be fixed or modifiable?
2. Will allocation be static or dynamic?
3. Will it host elements of a single type or multiple types?
4. Will it be implemented as raw memory or an object with attributes?

## Describing a Data Structure

When defining a data structure, ensure a clear and comprehensive specification:

1. **Specify the API**:
   - Focus on the methodsâ€™ input and output.
2. **High-Level Behavior**:
   - Describe how the data structure functions conceptually.
3. **Concrete Implementation**:
   - Provide detailed behavior of its implementation.
4. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Analyze the performance of its methods.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

**Relationship:**

- **Data Structures**:
  - Organize an area of memory to represent data.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Procedures that transform data using sequences of instructions.

### Summary:

- Algorithms are defined by:
  1. Input.
  2. Output.
  3. A sequence of instructions to process the input and produce the output.
- A data structure is a concrete implementation of an ADT. It consists of:
  1. A structure to hold data.
  2. Algorithms to manipulate the data.

## Abstraction in Problem Solving

**Abstracting a Problem:**

1. Create a clear problem statement.
2. Discuss and analyze the solution.

By separating the abstract definition from concrete implementation details, one can focus on finding efficient, context-specific solutions.
